HACKING

There are n main sections to OpenRA: UI, Rendering, unit behaviour, ...

All  units/structures/most things in the map are Actors. Actors contain a  collection of traits.
Traits consist of an info class and a  class that does stuff

Actor assembly is done via the mod's yaml files. A section  exists for each actor type, 
and within that section we list the traits  the actor should have. 
These get looked up in the loaded mod DLLs. Each trait can contain properties, 
which are automatically loaded into the corresponding fields on the trait's ITraitInfo.

- Traits: look at TraitInterfaces.cs
    We've tried to make individual traits implement as self-contained a unit of functionality 
    as possible - all cross-trait references should be in terms of an interface from 
    TraitInterfaces.cs.
    
- Things an actor can be *doing* are represented as IActivity implementations. 
    Actor has a queue of these. There's a standard set of activities in 
    OpenRa.Game/Traits/Activities, and mods tend to define more as they need them. (RA 
    defines various special-infantry actions as activities).

- Units offer orders they can perform (given context) through traits that implement IIssueOrder. 
  Every trait with this interface is given a chance to generate orders for the current context.

- For more complex things that require modal UI (like special abilities, 
  RA-style sell/repair buttons, etc) we have IOrderGenerator implementations. This can 
  completely replace the normal actors-provide-orders model temporarily. IOGs wiring is 
  provided through OpenRa.Game/Controller.cs (ToggleInputMode<T>, CancelInputMode)

- Things that don't affect gameplay, or (increasingly) are just transient are implemented as 
  IEffect, rather than real Actors. This is similar to the temp ents mechanism in many other 
  game engines.

- Most player-level or global-level game behavior is implemented as traits on special Player 
  and World actors. These are accessible via Player.PlayerActor and World.WorldActor. This 
  includes production queue support, ore/tiberium growth, various palette manipulation magic.

- Many traits can be modified by adding an appropriate IFooModifier implementation to the unit.
  This includes rendering, where IRenderModifier allows you to define an arbitrary transform on 
  the Renderables emitted by the actor's IRender implementation(s). Examples are things like 
  cloaking, invisibility to certain players, flying units with shadows, etc. Other modifiers 
  can affect movement speed, damage taken, weapon firepower, etc.

Game code is collected into "Mod" units. Mods can be added prior to starting the game. 
Currently there is no dependancy mechanism, but provided you are doing additions or overrides 
you can add multiple mods without problem.
Everything is a mod  (including RA - which is loaded by default). 

The contents of the mod is defined in a manifest file mod.yaml. This lists the packages 
containing art assets (typically .mix files), yaml files defining actor defintions, 
and ini files containing legacy information that have yet to be ported over to 
the (relatively new) yaml system.

The unit artwork itself must be defined in a Sequences file (typically Sequences.xml; 
check mod.yaml for a list of what the mod uses); the format is self explanatory. There is 
also the SequenceEditor tool to make this easy.

Chrome artwork is similarly defined in Chrome.xml. Chrome is already mod dependent. Sortof ;) 
mod-dependent *behavior* would be nice too, not just skinning. This is a property of the traits
however; once we port UI into traits this will become a non-issue.

Rendering
OpenRa.Game/Chrome.cs is the user interface. 
Three renderers (SpriteRenderer, LineRenderer, Rgba?Renderer) render most stuff. Don't forget 
to flush the renderer (if you want to see anything).

UserSettings stores the data loaded from settings.ini (or defaults). Eventually we need to be 
able to save values changed in game into settings.ini (not yet implemented)

Bugs: There is a list of known bugs and features at http://red-bull.ijw.co.nz:3690/OpenRA .

We also have a website at http://www.open-ra.org/ . 

Our IRC channel is #openra on irc.freenode.net .

As far as using git, get your own repository on github. You probably want to set up the gitbot
to spam irc when you make commits (its nice to know). Push your changes into your git 
repository, and it will/might :P be merged into chrisforbes/OpenRA . 
See http://help.github.com/ for working with GitHub and see http://progit.org/ for working 
with Git.



Other things we probably want to put in here:
    - A guide on how to add a generic unit via yaml using existing traits
        - and then introduce some element that requires a simple trait change.
    - how to set up a new mod (TC-style or mutator-style)
    - VFS (OpenRa.FileFormats.FileSystem, Package, Folder classes)
    - Trait inheritance (and the magicness of ^ActorType)
    - Removing inherited traits (prepend `-` to the trait name)
    - Multiple instances of a trait (`@` and all subsequent characters are ignored for 
        the purposes of looking up the trait.
