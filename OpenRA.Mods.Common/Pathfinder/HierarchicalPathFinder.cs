	/// <summary>
	/// Provides pathfinding abilities for actors that use a specific <see cref="Locomotor"/>.
	/// Maintains a hierarchy of abstract graphs that provide a more accurate heuristic function during
	/// A* pathfinding than the one available from <see cref="PathSearch.DefaultCostEstimator(Locomotor)"/>.
	/// This allows for faster pathfinding.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>The goal of this pathfinder is to increase performance of path searches. <see cref="PathSearch"/> is used
	/// to perform a path search as usual, but a different heuristic function is provided that is more accurate. This
	/// means fewer nodes have to be explored during the search, resulting in a performance increase.</para>
	///
	/// <para>When an A* path search is performed, the search expands outwards from the source location until the
	/// target is found. The heuristic controls how this expansion occurs. When the heuristic of h(n) = 0 is given, we
	/// get Dijkstra's algorithm. The search grows outwards from the source node in an expanding circle with no sense
	/// of direction. This will find the shortest path by brute force. It will explore many nodes during the search,
	/// including lots of nodes in the opposite direction to the target.</para>
	///
	/// <para><see cref="PathSearch.DefaultCostEstimator(Locomotor)"/> provides heuristic for searching a 2D grid. It
	/// estimates the cost as the straight-line distance between the source and target nodes. The search grows in a
	/// straight line towards the target node. This is a vast improvement over Dijkstra's algorithm as we now
	/// prioritize exploring nodes that lie closer to the target, rather than exploring nodes that take us away from
	/// the target.</para>
	///
	/// <para>This default straight-line heuristic still has drawbacks - it is unaware of the obstacles on the grid. If
	/// the route to be found requires steering around obstacles then this heuristic can perform badly. Imagine a path
	/// that must steer around a lake, or move back on itself to get out of a dead end. In these cases the straight-line
	/// heuristic moves blindly towards the target, when actually the path requires that we move sidewards or even
	/// backwards to find a route. When this occurs then the straight-line heuristic ends up exploring nodes that
	/// aren't useful - they lead us into dead ends or directly into an obstacle that we need to go around instead.
	/// </para>
	///
	/// <para>The <see cref="HierarchicalPathFinder"/> improves the heuristic by making it aware of unreachable map
	/// terrain. A "low-resolution" version of the map is maintained, and used to provide an initial route. When the
	/// search is conducted it explores along this initial route. This allows the search to "know" it needs to go
	/// sideways around the lake or backwards out of the dead-end, meaning we can explore even fewer nodes.</para>
	///
	/// <para>The "low-resolution" version of the map is referred to as the abstract graph. The abstract graph is
	/// created by dividing the map up into a series of grids, of say 10x10 nodes. Within each grid, we determine the
	/// connected regions of nodes within that grid. If all the nodes within the grid connect to each other, we have
	/// one such region. If they are split up by impassable terrain then we may have two or more regions within the
	/// grid. Every region will be represented by one node in the abstract graph (an abstract node, for short).</para>
	///
	/// <para>When a path search is to be performed, we first perform a A* search on the abstract graph with the
	/// <see cref="PathSearch.DefaultCostEstimator(Locomotor)"/>. This graph is much smaller than the full map, so
	/// this search is quick. The resulting path gives us the initial route between each abstract node. We can then use
	/// this to create the improved heuristic for use on the path search on the full resolution map. When determining
	/// the cost for the node, we can use the straight-line distance towards the next abstract node as our estimate.
	/// Our search is therefore guided along the initial route.</para>
	///
	/// <para>This implementation only maintains one level of abstract graph, but a hierarchy of such graphs is
	/// possible. This allows the top-level and lowest resolution graph to be as small as possible - important because
	/// it will be searched using the dumbest heuristic. Each level underneath is higher-resolution and contains more
	/// nodes, but uses a heuristic informed from the previous level to guide the search in the right direction.</para>
	///
	/// <para>This implementation is aware of movement costs over terrain given by
	/// <see cref="Locomotor.MovementCostToEnterCell"/>. It is aware of changes to the costs in terrain and able to
	/// update the abstract graph when this occurs. It is able to search the abstract graph as if
	/// <see cref="BlockedByActor.None"/> had been specified. If <see cref="BlockedByActor.Immovable"/> is given in the
	/// constructor, the abstract graph will additionally account for a subset of immovable actors using the same rules
	/// as <see cref="Locomotor.CanMoveFreelyInto(Actor, CPos, BlockedByActor, Actor)"/>. It will be aware of changes
	/// to actors on the map and update the abstract graph when this occurs. Other types of blocking actors will not be
	/// accounted for in the heuristic.</para>
	///
	/// <para>If the obstacle on the map is from terrain (e.g. a cliff or lake) the heuristic will work well. If the
	/// obstacle is from the subset of immovable actors (e.g. trees, walls, buildings) and
	/// <see cref="BlockedByActor.Immovable"/> was given, the heuristic will work well. If the obstacle is from other
	/// actors (e.g. units) then the heuristic is unaware of these. Therefore the same problem where the search goes in
	/// the wrong direction is possible, e.g. through a choke-point that has units blocking it. In this scenario the
	/// performance benefit will be lost, as the search will have to explore more nodes until it can get around the
	/// obstacle.</para>
	///
	/// <para>In summary, the <see cref="HierarchicalPathFinder"/> reduces the performance impact of path searches that
	/// must go around terrain, and some types of actor, but does not improve performance of searches that must go
	/// around the remaining types of actor.</para>
	/// </remarks>
