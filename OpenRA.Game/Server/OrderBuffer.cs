	 * they should be able to maintain a deterministic simulation with a mostly expected result.
	 *
	 * This allows the server to act as a dumb "master order synchronizer", simply acting as the authority and central
	 * point of synchronization on which orders to resolve each frame.
	 *
	 * The buffer is fairly simple, it maintains a list of all incoming order packets, minus their associated frames,
	 * so that all orders can be batched for a single frame to all clients at a time of the server's choosing.
	 *
	 * A mechanism for clients to inform/request slowdown should be provided so that clients which are overloaded do
	 * not fall behind indefinitely.
