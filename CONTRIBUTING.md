For questions and feature discussions, please use the the maillist or the IRC channel as described in the [community section](http://studio.zerobrane.com/community) of the project website.

# Bugs

When filing a bug, please help us reproduce the issue by including the following information:

* Steps to reproduce the issue as well as the expected result. Screenshots also help.
* Your operating system and the IDE version (or the latest commit if you are using the development version).
* Any relevant configuration from the config file, if you cannot reproduce the issue with an empty config.
* Any relevant plugins, if you cannot reproduce the issue without plugins.

It always helps to make sure that the issue is still reproducible with the most recent version of the IDE.

If you think that the issue is with the *debugger* (this also includes serialization issues), then open an issue in the [MobDebug repository](https://github.com/pkulchenko/MobDebug/issues).
If the issue is with one of the *plugins*, then open an issue in the [ZeroBranePackage repository](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBranePackage/issues).
