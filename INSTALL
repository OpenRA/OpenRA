Copyright 2007-2013 The OpenRA Developers (see AUTHORS)
This file is part of OpenRA, which is free software. It is made 
available to you under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation. For more information,
see COPYING.

To run OpenRA, several files are needed from the original game disks.
These files are now downloaded and installed by the game,
so so no explicit action is required.

Dependencies - Make sure you have these installed, or you'll 
have very strange errors.

WINDOWS:

* .NET Framework >= 3.5-SP1
	(http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=AB99342F-5D1A-413D-8319-81DA479AB0D7&displaylang=en)
* Tao Framework >= 2.1.0
	This is now bundled with OpenRA, copy the files in thirdparty/Tao to the game root directory.
* OpenAL >= 1.1
	(http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip)
* Cg Toolkit >= 2.2
	(http://developer.download.nvidia.com/cg/Cg_2.2/Cg-2.2_October2009_Setup.exe)

To compile OpenRA, open the OpenRA.sln solution in the main folder,
or build it from the command-line with MSBuild.

Run the game with `OpenRA.Game.exe Game.Mods=ra` for Red Alert
or `OpenRA.Game.exe Game.Mods=cnc` for Command & Conquer


UBUNTU (substitute comparable packages for other Linux distros):
* mono-runtime (>= 2.10)
* mono-gmcs
* freetype
* libmono-corlib1.0-cil
* libmono-winforms2.0-cil
* libopenal1
* libsdl1.2-dev
* nvidia-cg-toolkit (for Cg renderer)

OpenRA does not work with some older versions of Compiz. On affected systems, disable desktop effects before playing. This is fixed in Ubuntu Natty and later.

The following dlls can also be installed into your system GAC. This is not
recommended because we ship a custom Tao.FreeType that can conflict with
other applications that use Tao:

	gacutil -i Tao.Cg.dll
	gacutil -i Tao.OpenGl.dll
	gacutil -i Tao.OpenAl.dll
	gacutil -i Tao.Sdl.dll
	gacutil -i Tao.FreeType.dll
	gacutil -i ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll

To compile OpenRA, run `make' from the command line.
To install run 'make install'.
Run the game with `mono OpenRA.Game.exe Game.Mods=ra` for Red Alert
or `mono OpenRA.Game.exe Game.Mods=cnc` for Command & Conquer

SLACKWARE:

The following packages from slackbuilds.org are required, on 13.37 32bit:
* libgdiplus
* mono
* openAL
* nvidia-cg-toolkit (for Cg renderer)
