Description: A multiplayer re-envisioning of Westwood Studios' C&C and C&C: Red Alert
 .
 OpenRA is a Libre/Free Real Time Strategy game engine supporting early
 Westwood games like Command & Conquer and Command & Conquer: Red Alert.
 The engine is designed from the ground up to be extremely moddable and
 natively supports user-created maps and mods.
 Support can be obtained from our IRC channel (#openra on irc.freenode.net),
 our forum (http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=80), and our
 bug tracker (http://bugs.open-ra.org).
