## rules.yaml
briefing = Harvest Spice from the Imperial Basin. Construct a Spice Refinery and defend it against the Harkonnen troops scattered throughout the basin. You have been assigned only limited offensive forces - use them wisely.
    
    You will have to learn the subtleties of mining as you go. Remember to build Silos to store Spice; without storage, you cannot gather more. Any building without adequate concrete foundation will need immediate repair and be vulnerable to erosive damage from the harsh environment. Your greatest adversary may be the elements.
    
    Good luck.
