briefing = According to our spies, the Fremen are being held at the far Northwest corner of Sietch Tabr. Push your way through the Harkonnen ranks to rescue the hostages.
    
    Scout the terrain before you launch the main assault. Our Engineers must reach the Barracks and capture it intact. The rest of the base can be razed to the ground.
    
    Additionally, rumors suggest an illegal Smuggling operation in the area. A large shipment of contraband is expected at the Smuggler's Starport. Capture the Starport before the contraband arrives, to seize it for the Atreides war effort.
    
    Be warned, the Smugglers have Mercenary allies who may come to their aid.
    
    Good luck.
