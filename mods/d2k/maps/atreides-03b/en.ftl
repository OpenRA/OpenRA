briefing = Bring the Atreides forces up to combat strength - quickly. Guard against surprise attacks and ensure Spice production.
    
    The Ordos forces are lightly armored but numerous. To combat them, you are authorized to produce Quads, which have a greater anti-vehicle capability than Trikes. Upgrade your Light Factories to allow production of these units.
    
    Meet any aggression with overwhelming force.
    
    Good luck.
