Title: Atreides 03a

Description: Bring the Atreides forces up to combat strength - quickly. Guard against surprise attacks and ensure Spice production.\n\nThe Ordos forces are light but numerous. To combat the Ordos, you have been granted license to produce Quads, which have a greater anti-vehicle capability than Trikes. Upgrade your Light Factories to allow production of these units.\n\nMeet any agression with overwhelming force.\n\nGood luck.\n
