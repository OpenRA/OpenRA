## rules.yaml
briefing = The Smugglers at Sietch Tabr must be neutralized. Capture the Outpost where their families have taken shelter as insurance. The children's lives will assure the loyalties of their fathers. Use an Engineer to enter and capture the building.
    
    The Smugglers' new partners, the Harkonnen, may attempt to intervene. Harkonnen firepower is great, but we have recently acquired tanks that may counter this.
    
    Ensure our investment is used wisely.
