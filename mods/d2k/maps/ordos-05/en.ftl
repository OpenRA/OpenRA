briefing = Spice is paramount. The Atreides control it. Capture their Starport and bring in an MCV to start mining.
    
    Combat is costly. Fight only if the Atreides obstruct the flow of spice. Use the minimum amount of funds for defense.
    
    Mine and store what is needed to pay our debt to the Ixians. Once that amount has been collected, Ordos forces will withdraw.
