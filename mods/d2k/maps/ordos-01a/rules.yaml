		Briefing: Spice is wealth. Serve the Ordos by harvesting Spice in the Imperial Basin. If Harkonnen forces attempt to interrupt the flow of the Spice - neutralize them.\n\nEfficiency dictates that Silos must be built to avoid loss of Spice. Build concrete foundations to avoid unnecessary damage from the elements. To do otherwise is wasteful.
