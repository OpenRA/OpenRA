# make structures appear earlier when errecting from ground
# too few DATA.R8 frames?
# carryalls should automatically transport harvesters (needs complex logic)
# windtrap animations missing
# outpost animations missing
# construction yard crane animations missing
# welding animation (factories) missing
# chimney animation (refinery) missing
# harvester unload and harvest animation missing
# add more spice tiles and make them fit
# add game logic for concrete plates (use terrain overlay from bridges/ressources)
# allow placing turrets on walls
# RenderBuildingTurreted does not support separate turret sequence
# ornithocopter should flap (might need new RenderOrni code for proper animation)
# R8 converter needs infantry frame resorter
# add grenade thrower
# add sandworm (behave like a moving anti-vehicle mine)
# add thumper which deploys and really attracts sandworms
# add neutral buildings: emperor palace, fremen siech, smugglers factory
# add deathhand missile (nuke)
# maybe add ornithocopter strikes (they are currently directly contrallable units with non-reloading machine guns as in Dune II)
# allow upgrades
# allow different EVA voices for each faction (currently Atreides only)
# add muzzles and explosions (currently falls back to RA)
# create a shellmap (currently just a blank placeholder)
# rework chrome UI, dialoges, tabs
# add sonic tank weapon (currently uses tesla)
# make deviator change the allegiance of ememy units (currently shoots rockets)
# allow frigate to deliver 5 units at once to starport
# starport prices should vary
# reinforcements have arrived is played twice when ordering via starport
# fix shroud, currently falls back to 24x24 shadow from RA (Dune's 32x32 tiles differ completely from RA/CnC)
# black spots on buildings should be fading team colors
# gamefile extraction (setup/setup.z) from CD fails
# support patch 1.06 gamefiles: DATA.R8 has more frames and currently fails to extract, also featuring new terrain with white houses and new unit: grenade thrower
# mouse cursor has no transparency and is a little pixelish
# infantry-only areas (Rough) do not show the dark-green mouse cursor
# put TilesetBuilder.Export into OpenRA.Utility to call the functions directly when extracting game-files (instead of opening a GUI)
# replace RA sounds by Dune 2000 ones
