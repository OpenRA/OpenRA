briefing = We have infiltrated the Soviets' Sarin facility. However, the main entrance is guarded by a wall of Tesla coils. We can't move a large force in until they are taken down.
    
    Infiltrate the power grid to the east or destroy the power plants. Once done, reinforcements will arrive.
    
    Destroy the Soviet compound, but capture all of the Sarin processor buildings intact -- we can't risk a chemical spill.
