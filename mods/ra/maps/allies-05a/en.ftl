briefing = Rescue Tanya.
    
    Once disguised, your spy can move past any enemy unit, except dogs, without being detected. Direct him into the weapons factory located at a nearby Soviet base where he can hijack a truck and free Tanya.
    
    With Tanya's help, take out the air defenses on the island so a Chinook can arrive to rescue her.
    
    Then destroy all remaining Soviet buildings and units.
