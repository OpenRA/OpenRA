briefing = One of our outposts is under heavy attack from a nearby Soviet base. Einstein, Tanya and many of our forces were evacuated by helicopter, but were shot down on the other side of the river. Fortunately they survived the crash, but are now stranded in enemy territory and must fight their way out. The air defenses must be eliminated before another Search & Rescue helicopter can arrive.
    
    Meanwhile, those left at the base need to fend off Soviet attacks.
