briefing = Our latest technology, the Chronosphere, is housed in this research station. The timer represents the appointed time for the completion of a vital experiment. The Soviets have learned of this and are moving in. 
    
    Protect the Chronosphere and the Advanced-Tech research center. Make sure the base is fully powered at the appointed time. If not, all will be lost!
