## rules.yaml
briefing = We've lost contact with one of our outposts. Before it went offline, we received a brief communique about giant ants. We're unsure what to make of this report, so we need you to investigate.  
    
    Scout the area, bring the outpost back online, and report your findings. If there is a threat, reinforcements will be sent in to help you.  
    
    Keep the base operational and maintain radio contact -- losing this outpost again is not an option.
