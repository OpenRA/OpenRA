briefing = The Allies have infiltrated one of our nuclear reactors! They have tampered with the core so that a meltdown is imminent within 30 minutes. They must not succeed!
    
    Enter the base and find any remaining technicians. Guide them to the 4 coolant stations so they can activate them, then activate the main computer. The security systems have been armed so beware.
    
    Kill any Allies you find.
