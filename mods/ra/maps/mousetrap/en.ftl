briefing = A longtime thorn in our side, the Greek commander Stavros, has finally been cornered. He has taken refuge in an underground bunker full of his Chronosphere technology. Prove to him that no Allied tricks can stop the wrath of the Soviet Union. Track him down, and eliminate him.
    
    Return with results -- we do not want to hear of his escape... only the creative manner of his demise.
    
    We have provided you with engineers that, given the opportunity, can use Chronosphere technology. Do not squander them.
