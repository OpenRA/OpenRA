briefing = The Soviet Air Force is conducting air raids on a civilian village.
    
    We must do everything in our power to stop them!
    
    Your job is to establish a base on the mainland ASAP. We can prevent the village's destruction by capturing the enemy's Air Force Headquarters. The enemy base is heavily guarded. You won't have time to build a force big enough to overpower the Soviet defenses. Find a way to sneak in!
    
    Good luck, Commander!
