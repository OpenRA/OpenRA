briefing = We've traced the convoy's route to an underground facility. We suspect that this is a hidden access point to the Soviets' main Sarin plant.
    
    Lead your troops through the tunnels and remove any opposition you encounter. Be careful -- the Soviets are conducting all kinds of research here, and we don't know what they might use against you.
    
    Use spies to scout and infiltrate factories to steal vehicles.
    
    The mission is complete when your forces reach the far exit of the facility.
