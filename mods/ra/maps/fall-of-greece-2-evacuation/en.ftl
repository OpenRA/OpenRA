briefing = Soviet forces are advancing into rural Athens, threatening the civilian population. Evacuate civilians from each of the four towns to the island in the northeast. 
    
    The civilians are hiding in the town churches, and will only come out once when you enter the town. Get in, get them out, and get them to the island.
    
    The civilians are your primary objective - removing the Soviet threat is optional.
