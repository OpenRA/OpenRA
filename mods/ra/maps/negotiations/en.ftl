briefing = A Soviet force has holed up in a small town, threatening to kill a hostage every few minutes until their demands are met. We do not negotiate with terrorists -- explain this to them.
    
    Locate the hostages, free as many of them as you can, and get them safely to a nearby abandoned church. Once done, return to your drop-off point, signal for reinforcements, and finish off the Soviet forces.
